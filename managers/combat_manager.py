# TODO This combat manager will need to handle multiple scenarios.
# Anything could target anything, basically.
# If we want to have good messages tying together we will need to use many enums.
# Types could be Melee, Ranged, Magic
# Subtypes would vary but they should include types like, Melee - Sword, Melee - Unarmed, Ranged - Arrow, Magic - Bolt
# We should also have a list of attacks and defenses for each type and they should be limited to a particular
# skill level.

# The target must also be taken into account, being able to block, dodge, counter.
# Can't counter a Ranged attack with Melee defense, for example.

# Different maneuvers would use different stats, a dodge could use dex, block use str and magic defense could be wisdom.

# One attack should only be vulnerable to a single counter.
# We could also have finishers to execute in gory details, a small chance to happen when the target is low hp,
# but could also be triggered manually by attacking an unconscious creature.

# In all this, we should also support channeled attacks, ki beams anyone?
# This channeling would be a sort of sustained attack.

# Any limb attacked should be able to be crippled and all cripples will vary depending on damage type.
# Like that, severed limbs would bleed out, crushed and burnt limbs would inflict massive pain.
